 This is Our version of Pacman, besides the basic features we added: ascii art at welcome screen, PC alarm when collision with ghosts, some nice colors, 
3 modes : 
 1) easy - ghosts move randomly
 2) medium - ghosts chase pacman and once in every 15 moves they will do 5 random moves
 3) expert - ghosts chase pacman all theway 
 ** if pacman is hiding inside a wall crack(edges with no walls which arent teleports) the ghosts will try to look for him
    as if he dissappeared.
 
 a fruit which appears randomly in a random spot once in a while and will grant bonus points
 
 an option on menu to load a specific level from working directory
